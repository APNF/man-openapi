    # Introduction

    Welcome to the APNF MAN platform GCO (*Gestionnaire des Certificats Opérateurs*) API reference.
    The APIs listed in this reference provide functionalities for service providers to create and
    manage the STI certificates to be used for signing their SIP telephone calls per the STIR SHAKEN
    protocol, along with functionalities to manage access to the MAN platform.

    Each provider registered with the APNF may request an access to the MAN platform and therefore these APIs.

    Note that these APIs are a subset of APIs published by the platform. You can refer to the *References*
    at the end of this section to get a list of all API references published for the MAN platform.

    ## Authentication

    All APIs listed in this document require the API client to be authenticated.
    The authentication process relies on OAuth 2.0 protocol, where an access token needs
    to be passed to the API request as a JSON Web TOKEN using the Bearer `Authorization` header.

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
    ```

    Refer to the *MAN Platform Authorization API Reference* on how to generate access tokens. Note that in order to
    request an access token, you will first need to create an **API credential** as described in this reference.

    ## Requests & Headers

    - A Bearer `Authorization` header is required, where the Bearer token shall be set with the access token generated by the MAN platform authorization API.
    - A `X-Request-Id` header can be provided with an uuid. If provided, this header will be returned in the
    `X-Response-Id` response header.

    ## Responses & Headers

    Unless explicitly specified, all responses will use JSON for the response body format.
    The `Content-Type` header will be included in all responses to make the type explicit.

    Following headers are also included in responses:
    - `Content-Type`: format of the response, if a body is included in the response.
    - `Content-Length`: size in bytes of the response body, if a body is included in the response.
    - `X-Response-Id`: uniquely identifies the response sent to the client. It corresponds to the `X-Request-Id`
      request header if provided. Otherwise, a new value is generated,
    - `X-Correlation-Id`: ID generated by the API gateway to track the request between the different services. This
      value can be different from the `X-Response-Id` header.

    ## Dates

    Unless specified, all dates exposed in this API comply with the ISO-8601 date format using UTC as the timezone.

    ## Common Error Codes

    The following error codes can be returned:

    | Error code | Description                                                             |
    |:----------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **400**    | The request is malformed.                                               |
    | **401**    | The authentication failed.                                              |
    | **403**    | User is not allowed to access to the resource.                          |
    | **404**    | The resource does not exist.                                            |
    | **405**    | The method is not allowed for the resource.                             |
    | **406**    | The format in the `Accept` header is not supported.                     |
    | **409**    | There is a conflict between the object status and the action requested  |
    | **415**    | The format in the `Content-Type` header is not supported.               |
    | **429**    | Too many requests have been sent by the client (see Rate Limiting).      |
    | **500**    | An unexpected error occurred while processing the request.              |
    | **503**    | The service is unavailable.                                             |

    ## Rate Limiting

    To ensure availability to all clients, concurrent accesses to this API are restricted per
    below rate limiting logic:

    - Each IP address is allowed to perform up to 600 calls during a period of 1 minute.
    - The `GET /bpco/certificates` API method has an additional restriction, limiting calls to 1 per minute.
    - Any additional call will be rejected by the API using a 429 "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS" error code

      Service provider registration, authorization and data management APIs.

      While most of these APIs can only be accessed by the MAN platform administrators
      to create and authorize service providers, these latter have access to a subset
      for updating their organization settings and reviewing their authorization status & history.
  - name: STI Certificates
    description: |
      STI certificates creation and management APIs.

      These APIs provide to service providers a full control of their STI certificates, with
      support of functionalities like certificate renewal, revocation and delegation.

    description: |
      STI certificates access APIs.

      3 months after their expiration, STI certificates are automatically archived by the platform
      and removed from the list of certificates. For tracking and forensics purposes, they however remain
      available for 3 years in a dedicated list, after which they are deleted
      once for all from the platform.

      These APIs just provide read-only access; no updates are allowed on certificates once archived.
  - name: BPCO
    description: |
      APIs related to BPCO (Base Publique des Certificats Opérateurs), the MAN platform public access
      service to STI certificates.

      These APIs provide access to metadata and download facilities to objects
      published in the BPCO, like STI certificates and CRLs.

      description: |
        Initiate the creation of a new certificate. Shall always be called by the origin signing service provider.
        Two types of certificates can be created, for which the creation process will be different:
        * Direct certificates (type = `DIRECT`) are used directly by the origin signing service provider
        * Indirect certificates (type = `INDIRECT`) are requested by the origin signing service provider for a technical signing service provider (OPTS).

        While the creation of direct certificates is fully handled by this API, the process for indirect certificates is composed of 2 stages:
        * This API initiates the certificate request
        * The OPTS shall then call the `POST /certificates/{certificate_id}` to finalize the creation of the
          certificate.

        **Allowed Roles**: *ADMINISTRATOR*, *MANAGER*

        - *ADMINISTRATOR* and *MANAGER* can initiate the creation of a new certificate only for its own provider.

      description: |
        This method returns as a GZipped TAR file a copy of all the STI certificates currently published in the BPCO.

        If the `since` parameter is specified, the GZipped TAR file only contains the certificates published in the BPCO or
        removed from it since the date provided in the parameter.
        The list of certificates removed from the BPCO are available in a `removed-certificates.csv` file included in the tarball.

        A `If-Modified-Since` request header may also be specified. In that case, a **304** response is returned if no certificates
        have been added or removed since the date specified in the header. This latter can be filled with the value of the
        `Last-Modified` response header collected from a previous call to this API or the `HEAD /bpco/certificates` one.
