    # API for the emulated MAN GCO endpoints

    This is the OpenAPI specification for the GCO endpoints, as provided by APNF under the CC-BY-SA-4.0 license,
    and edited by Metaswitch (an Alianza company) under the same license. These edits remove several endpoints,
    methods, request and response parameters, and response codes from the APNF version for Metaswitch's client-side
    use-case, and make minor adjustments to the description fields for nicer output with the Swagger OpenAPI tool.

    There follows information retained from the original API definition. Much of the function described is not
    present in this version of the API so may not be accurate for implementations based on this file.

    # Introduction

    Welcome to the APNF MAN platform GCO (*Gestionnaire des Certificats Opérateurs*) API reference.
    The APIs listed in this reference provide functionalities for service providers to create and
    manage the STI certificates to be used for signing their SIP telephone calls per the STIR SHAKEN
    protocol, along with functionalities to manage access to the MAN platform.

    Each provider registered with the APNF may request an access to the MAN platform and therefore these APIs.

    ## Authentication

    All APIs listed in this document require the API client to be authenticated.
    The authentication process relies on OAuth 2.0 protocol, where an access token needs
    to be passed to the API request as a JSON Web TOKEN using the Bearer `Authorization` header.

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
    ```

    Refer to the *MAN Platform Authorization API Reference* on how to generate access tokens. Note that in order to
    request an access token, you will first need to create an **API credential** as described in this reference.

    ## Requests & Headers

    - A Bearer `Authorization` header is required, where the Bearer token shall be set with the access token generated by the MAN platform authorization API.
    - A `X-Request-Id` header can be provided with an uuid. If provided, this header will be returned in the
    `X-Response-Id` response header.

    ## Responses & Headers

    Unless explicitly specified, all responses will use JSON for the response body format.
    The `Content-Type` header will be included in all responses to make the type explicit.

    Following headers are also included in responses:
    - `Content-Type`: format of the response, if a body is included in the response.
    - `Content-Length`: size in bytes of the response body, if a body is included in the response.
    - `X-Response-Id`: uniquely identifies the response sent to the client. It corresponds to the `X-Request-Id`
      request header if provided. Otherwise, a new value is generated,
    - `X-Correlation-Id`: ID generated by the API gateway to track the request between the different services. This
      value can be different from the `X-Response-Id` header.

    ## Dates

    Unless specified, all dates exposed in this API comply with the ISO-8601 date format using UTC as the timezone.

    ## Common Error Codes

    The following error codes can be returned:

    | Error code | Description                                                             |
    |:----------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **400**    | The request is malformed.                                               |
    | **401**    | The authentication failed.                                              |
    | **403**    | User is not allowed to access to the resource.                          |
    | **404**    | The resource does not exist.                                            |
    | **405**    | The method is not allowed for the resource.                             |
    | **406**    | The format in the `Accept` header is not supported.                     |
    | **409**    | There is a conflict between the object status and the action requested  |
    | **415**    | The format in the `Content-Type` header is not supported.               |
    | **429**    | Too many requests have been sent by the client (see Rate Limiting).     |
    | **500**    | An unexpected error occurred while processing the request.              |
    | **503**    | The service is unavailable.                                             |

    ## Rate Limiting

    To ensure availability to all clients, concurrent accesses to this API are restricted per
    below rate limiting logic:

    - Each IP address is allowed to perform up to 600 calls during a period of 1 minute.
    - The `GET /bpco/certificates` API method has an additional restriction, limiting calls to 1 per minute.
    - Any additional call will be rejected by the API using a 429 "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS" error code

    Additional API references are also available, covering other functionalities:

        This method returns as a GZipped TAR file a copy of all the STI certificates currently published in the BPCO.

        If the `since` parameter is specified, the GZipped TAR file only contains the certificates published in the BPCO or
        removed from it since the date provided in the parameter.
        The list of certificates removed from the BPCO are available in a `removed-certificates.csv` file included in the tarball.

        A `If-Modified-Since` request header may also be specified. In that case, a **304** response is returned if no certificates
        have been added or removed since the date specified in the header. This latter can be filled with the value of the
        `Last-Modified` response header collected from a previous call to this API or the `HEAD /bpco/certificates` one.
